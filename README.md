## Design and User Experience



### User Stories
- As a restaurant owner I want that:
    - A system that helps me manage the orders.
    - All the options in the menu are displayed to the users.
    - Users cannot order something that is not in the displayed options.
    - The order price is calclated correctly.

- As a user I want:
    - That the system is easy to use and provides clear instructions.
    - See all the available options.
    - Being able to personalize my order.
    - Being able to check and modify my order before placing it.
    - That the price is calculated correctly.


### Flow Chart

To develop a program that answers all the needs identified above, I have created the following flow chart:

### Local Deployment
  - For a local deployment follow these steps:
    - Create a new directory on your machine, where you want do deploy the files
    - Open the existing repository in GitHub
    - Go to the "Code" tab
    - Click on the "Code" button
    - Copy the HTTPS link
    - Open your terminal and run the command __git clone 'link'__
    - use the link just copied, without quotes, instead of 'link'

## Credits 

### Code
- For this project I used the "Code Institute student template" required for deploying my third portfolio project (the Python command-line project). 

- The code to display the intro message as typwriter was taken from the [Learn Learn Scratch Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h8e0tXHfk0)
